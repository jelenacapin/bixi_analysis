The aim of this project is to provide a high level overview of how BIXI customers used their bikes in 2016 and 2017, what factors may have influenced usage at different times of the day and/or year, and to provide insights and information related to station popularity and usage patterns. The goal is to provide a general overview of business growth and what can be done to further grow BIXI's memberships and revenue.

### Data
You can download the datasets [here](https://www.bixi.com/en/open-data) - note that only Year 2016 and Year 2017 were used in this analysis. All OD_YYYY-MM.csv files were merged to create the `trips` table referenced in my sql script, and the Stations_2017.csv file was used as the `stations` table.
